1. Physical

I'm not going to use any kind of example or metaphor to explain the OSI model. The _physical_ layer is literally the physical manifestation of the connectivity. That means the actual ethernet patch cable, the copper strands inside it, and how many twists are made per foot inside of said cable. That naturally reflects the speed and other characteristics of the physical layer. The application can literally be the _Facebook_ mobile app that is installed on your person cell phone or mobile device.

The first and last layers are very important, but most individuals are not familiar with what's in between.
